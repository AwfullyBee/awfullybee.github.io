                            Japan is a fascinating island nation in East Asia, nestled in the Pacific Ocean not too far
                            from
                            the
                            Asian mainland.
                            It boasts four main islands and a staggering 14,000 smaller ones, stretching across roughly
                            378,000
                            square kilometers.
                            The country is organized into 47 prefectures and eight regions, characterized by its mostly
                            mountainous and lush forested landscapes.
                            The majority of the population and agricultural activities are found along the eastern
                            coastal
                            plains.
                            As of 2025, Japan is home to over 123 million people, making it the 11th most populous
                            country
                            in
                            the world, with Tokyo serving as its bustling capital and largest city.

                            Japanese culture is an uninterrupted blend of traditionalism and modernity, wherein
                            politeness,
                            harmony, and community take precedence. Culture like the tea ceremony, ikebana, and
                            calligraphy
                            coexist with hyper-advanced technology and an international cultural milieu. Most of the
                            customs
                            have their roots in Shinto and Buddhism, including seasonal festivals. The culinary arts of
                            Japan
                            afford importance to presentation and seasonal ingredients and this context can just go to

                            that
                            sushi, ramen, and tempura occupy a small niche in the large world of the cuisine in Japan.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Contemporary Japanese culture reflects a mixture of influences from Asia, Europe, and North
                        America. Traditional arts of Japan consist in a wide array of crafts such as ceramics, textiles,
                        lacquerware, sword making, and doll-making; and performing arts including bunraku, kabuki, noh,
                        traditional dance, and rakugo. The culture also includes the tea ceremony, ikebana (flower
                        arranging), martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen culture, Geisha culture, and various
                        traditional games. Japan has put forth enormous efforts for either protecting or strengthening
                        tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Japan boasts 22 UNESCO World
                        Heritage Sites, of which 18 are listed due to their cultural significance. Japan is inevitably
                        considered as a cultural power.

                            The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese
                            esthetics and imported ideas. The interaction between Japanese and European art has been
                            significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in
                            the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art
                            in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Japanese architecture is a combination of local and other influences. It has traditionally
                            been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with
                            tiled or thatched roofs. Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami
                            mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor
                            space. Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture
                            into construction and design. It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects
                            made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like
                            Kenzo Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.

                        <p>
                            The earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and
                            the Man'yōshū poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.
                            In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana)
                            was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest extant Japanese
                            narrative. An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon, while The
                            Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            During the Edo period, the chōnin ("townspeople") overtook the samurai aristocracy as
                            producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example,
                            reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bashō revivified the poetic
                            tradition of the Kokinshū with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no
                            Hosomichi. The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese
                            literature integrated Western influences. Natsume Sōseki and Mori Ōgai were significant
                            novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki,
                            Kafū Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel
                            Prize-winning authors - Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzaburō Ōe (1994).

                            Japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and
                            Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began
                            about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of
                            society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of
                            society. Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.

                            Japanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced
                            in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates
                            from the 16th century. Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms
                            an integral part of Japanese culture. Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in
                            postwar Japan and became very popular in North America. Popular music in post-war Japan has
                            been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of
                            J-pop. Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.

                            has increased, particularly following the co-hosting of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Japan's
                            soccer squads have claimed several Asian Cups and the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. Golf is

                            Summer Olympics in 1964 and 2020 (conducted in 2021), and the Winter Olympics in 1972 and
                            1998. It organized the 2006 and co-organized the 2023 Basketball World Championships. Japan
                            has held the Women's Volleyball World Championship more frequently than any other nation. It
                            is the top Rugby Union country in Asia and was the host of the 2019 Rugby World Cup

                            Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved
                            a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend.

                            Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes
                            and
                            local ingredients. Japanese Cuisine is very diverse, consisting of foods such as sushi,
                            katsu, ramen, etc. Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples. Japanese
                            curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can
                            be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi. Traditional Japanese sweets are known
                            as wagashi. Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes
                            include green tea ice cream.

                            Popular Japanese beverages include sake, a brewed rice beverage that typically contains
                            14-17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice. Beer has been brewed in Japan
                            since the late 17th century. Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as
                            matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.

                            Manga are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most
                            manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, and the form has a
                            long
                            history in earlier Japanese art. The term manga is used in Japan to refer to both comics and
                            cartooning. Outside of Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics originally
                            published
                            in Japan.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Manga originated from early Japanese picture scrolls, such as Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga from the
                            12th century. These scrolls combined art and storytelling in a way that laid the foundation
                            for later developments. During the Edo period, illustrated books like Toba Ehon continued to
                            evolve this visual narrative style.

                            The term "manga" began appearing in the late 1700s with works like Santō Kyōden's Shiji no
                            yukikai and became more widespread in the early 1800s through Hokusai's Manga books. At the
                            same time, kibyōshi, or popular picture books from the 18th century, began to resemble comic
                            books by using humor, satire, and romantic themes.

                        <p>
                            The development of modern manga is shaped by two major influences. One comes from Japan's
                            own long-standing artistic traditions. The other stems from Western cultural exposure after
                            World War II, particularly from American comics, films, and cartoons introduced during the
                            Allied occupation.

                            In the postwar period, manga saw rapid growth in both creativity and popularity. Osamu
                            Tezuka, with his work Astro Boy, introduced cinematic panel layouts that changed how stories
                            were told visually. Machiko Hasegawa's Sazae-san focused on ordinary life, helping define
                            the tone of shōjo manga, which targets young female readers.

                            By the 1950s and 60s, two major audiences had emerged. Shōnen manga targeted boys with
                            stories about robots, space travel, and adventure. Shōjo manga focused on relationships and
                            emotions, especially from a girl's perspective.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In 1969, a group of female artists known as the Year 24 Group helped transform shōjo manga
                            by adding emotional depth, psychological complexity, and more mature themes. Artists like
                            Moto Hagio and Riyoko Ikeda pioneered this shift. Over time, subgenres such as romance,
                            magical girls, and josei (manga for adult women) became popular.

                            Shōjo manga developed iconic characters and groups of heroines, as seen in Sailor Moon and
                            Mermaid Melody. These stories often explore themes of self-discovery, teamwork, and love.
                            Shōnen and seinen manga continued to grow with action-packed, heroic adventures, often
                            including fantasy, sports, or science fiction. Female characters became more varied,
                            including beautiful companions and powerful fighters.

                            By the early 2000s, manga had achieved global popularity. The 1990s brought more relaxed
                            censorship in Japan, leading to the rise of adult content in manga for male readers. This
                            trend also influenced English translations and led to public concern over age-appropriate
                            content.

                            Another important development was the rise of gekiga, a genre featuring realistic,
                            adult-focused stories often centered on the hardships of life. Created by artists like
                            Yoshihiro Tatsumi, gekiga offered a darker and more serious alternative to mainstream manga
                            and reflected both artistic dissatisfaction and political activism.

                    <p>
                        Anime (derived from a shortening of the English word
                        animation) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan
                        and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan. However, anime, in
                        Japan and in Japanese, describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Many works
                        of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan. Video
                        games sometimes also feature themes and art styles that may be labelled as anime.

                    <p>
                        Anime differs from other forms of animation by its art styles, methods of animation, its
                        production, and its process. Visually, anime works exhibit a wide variety of art styles,
                        differing between creators, artists, and studios. While no single art style predominates anime
                        as a whole, they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character
                        design.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Anime is fundamentally characterized by the use of limited animation, flat expression, the
                        suspension of time, its thematic range, the presence of historical figures, its complex
                        narrative line and, above all, a peculiar drawing style, with characters characterized by large
                        and oval eyes, with very defined lines, bright colors and reduced movement of the lips.

                    <p>
                        Emakimono and shadow plays (kage-e) are considered precursors of Japanese animation. Emakimono
                        was common in the eleventh century. Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while
                        the emakimono was unrolled from the right to left in chronological order, as a moving panorama.
                        Kage-e was popular during the Edo period and originated from the shadow plays of China. Magic
                        lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the eighteenth century. The paper play called
                        kamishibai surged in the twelfth century and remained popular in street theater until the 1930s.
                        Puppets of the Bunraku theater and ukiyo-e prints are considered ancestors of characters of most
                        Japanese animation. Finally, manga were a heavy inspiration for anime. Cartoonists Kitzawa
                        Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used film elements in their strips.

                        Animation in Japan began in the early 20th century, when filmmakers started to experiment with
                        techniques pioneered in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia. A claim for the earliest
                        Japanese animation is Katsudō Shashin (c.1907), a private work by an unknown creator. In 1917,
                        the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear; animators such as Ōten
                        Shimokawa, Seitarō Kitayama, and Jun'ichi Kōuchi (considered the "fathers of anime") produced
                        numerous films, the oldest surviving of which is Kōuchi's Namakura Gatana. Many early works were
                        lost with the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.

                        By the mid-1930s, animation was well-established in Japan as an alternative format to the
                        live-action industry. It suffered competition from foreign producers, such as Disney, and many
                        animators, including Noburō Ōfuji and Yasuji Murata, continued to work with cheaper cutout
                        animation rather than cel animation. Other creators, including Kenzō Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo,
                        nevertheless made great strides in technique, benefiting from the patronage of the government,
                        which employed animators to produce educational shorts and propaganda. In 1940, the government
                        dissolved several artists' organizations to form the Shin Nippon Mangaka Kyōkai. The first
                        talkie anime was Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka (1933), a short film produced by Masaoka. The
                        first feature-length anime film was Momotaro: Sacred Sailors (1945), produced by Seo with a
                        sponsorship from the Imperial Japanese Navy. The 1950s saw a proliferation of short, animated
                        advertisements created for television.

                    <p>
                        In the 1960s, Osamu Tezuka revolutionized anime by adapting Disney techniques to create low cost
                        limited animation productions. His series Astro Boy (1963-66) was an early success, influencing
                        future studios like Madhouse and Sunrise. Television became a major platform, with Three Tales
                        (1960) as the first anime film aired on TV and Instant History (1961-64) as the first series.

                        <br>
                        The 1970s saw anime grow alongside manga popularity. Tezuka and others helped shape major genres
                        like mecha, which evolved through creators like Go Nagai and Yoshiyuki Tomino (Gundam, Ideon).
                        The 1980s bubble economy brought high budget experimental films like Akira (1988) and Nausicaä
                        (1984).
                        <br><br>
                        In the 1990s, titles like Evangelion, Ghost in the Shell, and Cowboy Bebop gained global
                        acclaim, alongside Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z. Spirited Away (2003) became the highest
                        grossing anime film and won an Oscar.
                        <br><br>
                        From the 2000s, anime adaptations of light novels such as Haruhi Suzumiya and Fate/stay night
                        rose in popularity. Demon Slayer: Mugen Train (2020) broke box office records.
                        <br><br>
                        By the 2020s, anime like Jujutsu Kaisen, Demon Slayer, and Tokyo Revengers were among the most
                        discussed shows globally. Attack on Titan and Jujutsu Kaisen set world records for international
                        demand in TV entertainment.
