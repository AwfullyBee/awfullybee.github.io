                <h2> <u>What is Japan? </u></h2>
                <p>
                    Japan is a fascinating island nation in East Asia, nestled in the Pacific Ocean not too far from the
                    Asian mainland.
                    It boasts four main islands and a staggering 14,000 smaller ones, stretching across roughly 378,000
                    square kilometers.
                    The country is organized into 47 prefectures and eight regions, characterized by its mostly
                    mountainous and lush forested landscapes.
                    The majority of the population and agricultural activities are found along the eastern coastal
                    plains.
                    As of 2025, Japan is home to over 123 million people, making it the 11th most populous country in
                    the world, with Tokyo serving as its bustling capital and largest city.

                <h2> <u>Japan's Culture</u></h2>
                <p>
                    Japanese culture is an uninterrupted blend of traditionalism and modernity, wherein politeness,
                    harmony, and community take precedence. Culture like the tea ceremony, ikebana, and calligraphy
                    coexist with hyper-advanced technology and an international cultural milieu. Most of the customs
                    have their roots in Shinto and Buddhism, including seasonal festivals. The culinary arts of Japan
                    afford importance to presentation and seasonal ingredients and this context can just go to convey
                    that
                    sushi, ramen, and tempura occupy a small niche in the large world of the cuisine in Japan.

                <h2> <u>Japan's Manga and Anime</u></h2>
                <p>
                    Globally recognized for its extraordinary visual appeal and unique emotional expression of narrative
                    across genres such as shonen (action) and shojo (romance), anime really highlights the name of the
                    game. Estudio Ghibli tales, alongside Naruto, Attack on Titan, and Demon Slayer also set forth the
                    anime spirit. Manga, or Japanese comics (read from right to left), are equally concerned with anime
                    and cover all genres and target audiences, including some famous titles such as One Piece, Death
                    Note, and Berserk. It is through anime and manga that one will understand the nature of contemporary
                    Japanese cultural self-expression.
