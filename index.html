                            Japan is a fascinating island nation in East Asia, nestled in the Pacific Ocean not too far
                            from
                            the
                            Asian mainland.
                            It boasts four main islands and a staggering 14,000 smaller ones, stretching across roughly
                            378,000
                            square kilometers.
                            The country is organized into 47 prefectures and eight regions, characterized by its mostly
                            mountainous and lush forested landscapes.
                            The majority of the population and agricultural activities are found along the eastern
                            coastal
                            plains.
                            As of 2025, Japan is home to over 123 million people, making it the 11th most populous
                            country
                            in
                            the world, with Tokyo serving as its bustling capital and largest city.

                            Japanese culture is an uninterrupted blend of traditionalism and modernity, wherein
                            politeness,
                            harmony, and community take precedence. Culture like the tea ceremony, ikebana, and
                            calligraphy
                            coexist with hyper-advanced technology and an international cultural milieu. Most of the
                            customs
                            have their roots in Shinto and Buddhism, including seasonal festivals. The culinary arts of
                            Japan
                            afford importance to presentation and seasonal ingredients and this context can just go to

                            that
                            sushi, ramen, and tempura occupy a small niche in the large world of the cuisine in Japan.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Contemporary Japanese culture reflects a mixture of influences from Asia, Europe, and North
                        America. Traditional arts of Japan consist in a wide array of crafts such as ceramics, textiles,
                        lacquerware, sword making, and doll-making; and performing arts including bunraku, kabuki, noh,
                        traditional dance, and rakugo. The culture also includes the tea ceremony, ikebana (flower
                        arranging), martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen culture, Geisha culture, and various
                        traditional games. Japan has put forth enormous efforts for either protecting or strengthening
                        tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Japan boasts 22 UNESCO World
                        Heritage Sites, of which 18 are listed due to their cultural significance. Japan is inevitably
                        considered as a cultural power.

                            The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese
                            esthetics and imported ideas. The interaction between Japanese and European art has been
                            significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in
                            the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art
                            in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Japanese architecture is a combination of local and other influences. It has traditionally
                            been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with
                            tiled or thatched roofs. Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami
                            mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor
                            space. Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture
                            into construction and design. It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects
                            made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like
                            Kenzo Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.

                        <p>
                            The earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and
                            the Man'yōshū poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.
                            In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana)
                            was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest extant Japanese
                            narrative. An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon, while The
                            Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            During the Edo period, the chōnin ("townspeople") overtook the samurai aristocracy as
                            producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example,
                            reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bashō revivified the poetic
                            tradition of the Kokinshū with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no
                            Hosomichi. The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese
                            literature integrated Western influences. Natsume Sōseki and Mori Ōgai were significant
                            novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki,
                            Kafū Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel
                            Prize-winning authors - Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzaburō Ōe (1994).

                            Japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and
                            Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began
                            about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of
                            society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of
                            society. Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.

                            Japanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced
                            in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates
                            from the 16th century. Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms
                            an integral part of Japanese culture. Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in
                            postwar Japan and became very popular in North America. Popular music in post-war Japan has
                            been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of
                            J-pop. Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.

                            has increased, particularly following the co-hosting of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Japan's
                            soccer squads have claimed several Asian Cups and the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. Golf is

                            Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved
                            a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend.

                            Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes
                            and
                            local ingredients. Japanese Cuisine is very diverse, consisting of foods such as sushi,
                            katsu, ramen, etc. Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples. Japanese
                            curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can
                            be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi. Traditional Japanese sweets are known
                            as wagashi. Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes
                            include green tea ice cream.

                            Popular Japanese beverages include sake, a brewed rice beverage that typically contains
                            14-17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice. Beer has been brewed in Japan
                            since the late 17th century. Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as
                            matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.
